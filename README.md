# StudentInfo-Visual-C--Project
This is a Windows GUI project that was built by my group with significant contibutions by me.
This project uses the SQL management studio to manage the local database where student information is stored.
We obtain information by querying the local database with relevant queries.
To make the project work, enter the local database's server name, the username, and the password in the  "UsefullStrings" class.
